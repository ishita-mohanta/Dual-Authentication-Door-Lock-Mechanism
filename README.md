# Dual-Authentication-Door-Lock-Mechanism
This project builds a smart door lock using Arduino Uno with RFID, a 4x3 keypad, and an IR sensor. Users authenticate via RFID or password for secure access, while the IR sensor tracks occupancy. A servo controls locking, and an LCD shows live people count, ensuring safety and reliable access control.
## Project Abstract 
This project presents a smart, dual-authentication door lock system that integrates RFID technology, a 4x3 keypads, and an IR sensor for secure access and real-time occupancy tracking. 
An Arduino Uno serves as the central controller, interfacing with the MFRC522 RFID reader, keypad, servo motor, and LCD display. 
Users can authenticate using either an RFID tag or a password, providing flexibility and enhanced security. 
The IR sensor tracks entry and updates a live people count displayed on the LCD. 
Designed for secure environments like offices or labs, the system ensures reliable access control, unauthorized entry prevention, and improved space monitoring.

## Features 
Dual authentication: Supports both RFID tag and password-based access.

Enhanced security: Prevents unauthorized entry with flexible verification.

Real-time occupancy tracking: IR sensor monitors entry and exit.

Live people count: LCD display shows current room occupancy.

Automated locking: Servo motor controls the door mechanism reliably.

User-friendly interface: Clear LCD messages for status and guidance.

Scalable design: Can be extended for offices, labs, or secure facilities.
